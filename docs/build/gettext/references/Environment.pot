msgid "**We have collected and organized all config-related information and classified it for processing on both the C++ and Python sides. At the top level of the C++ side is `GptInitParameter`, which categorizes various environment variables in C++ into different configuration types. On the Python side, everything is summarized in `EnvArgs` under `rtp_llm/config/py_config_modules.py`. `EnvArgs` also categorizes various configurations, and throughout the system, various configurations are gradually propagated down to specified locations for use.**"

msgid "In `rtp_llm/cpp/th_op/ConfigModules.h`, all related parameter information classifications are placed here. Let's illustrate with the following example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../references/Environment.md:35
msgid "For example, after adding a new parameter, you need to specify the default value and modify the content of both the `to_string` and `update_from_env_for_test` functions. Additionally, these configurations are bound and passed to the Python side for interaction through `Pybind11`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../references/Environment.md:39
msgid "It's important to note that **the parameter order here must be consistent with the order defined in the struct**. This is a requirement of `Pybind11` because we need to pass these parameters from the Python side later. Specifically, in `rtp_llm/config/gpt_init_model_parameters.py`, when generating `GptInitModelParameters`, it calls `update_gpt_init_params_from_env` for update processing. The `GptInitParameter` updated here is actually defined in C++. In `rtp_llm/cpp/dataclass/EngineInitParameter.h`, parameters are constructed and updated during initialization. Later, these parameters are propagated down layer by layer to the corresponding function call locations as needed (all parameters are propagated down)."

msgid "The Python side has significantly more environment variables than the C++ side, and there is some overlap between the two. We have merged some Python-specific environment variables into the C++ side's config classification, while the rest have their own independent configuration classification sets on the Python side."
msgstr ""

#: ../../references/Environment.md:64
msgid "Currently, our design considers the current code architecture. Config retrieval exists in two scenarios: one is in some global methods or static methods where we directly obtain corresponding configuration parameters from `StaticConfig` in `rtp_llm/config/py_config_modules.py`, and for other cases, we obtain them by passing in `py_env_configs` configuration. Additionally, regarding Python-side environment variable modifications, we adhere to the following principles:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../references/Environment.md:66
msgid "**Principle: Environment variable settings in tests/Test environment variables/smoke test environment variables are all preserved. Global initialization environment variable settings and retrieval are also preserved (such as internal_source/rtp_llm/models/internal_init.py). env_param, etc., which exist for rpc_api transmission specification, are also preserved (such as rtp_llm/tools/api/model_size_evaluator_api.py).**"
