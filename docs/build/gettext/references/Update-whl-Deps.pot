msgid "All hardware dependencies are based on `open_source/deps/requirements_base.txt` as the foundational dependency configuration. If you need to add or update basic dependencies that apply to all hardware (such as fundamental libraries like transformers), you should add them in this file. For example:"

#: ../../references/Update-whl-Deps.md:21
msgid "If you need to add specialized dependencies for specific hardware (such as torch packages, hardware computation libraries, etc.), you must add these dependencies in the corresponding hardware-specific requirements files."
