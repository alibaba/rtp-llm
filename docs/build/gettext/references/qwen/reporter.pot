msgid "Qwen3-235B-A22B is smaller in model size compared to DeepSeek-V3 but supports seamless Thinking Mode switching. For 4K Input/2K Output scenarios, similar optimization strategies can be adopted, adjusting parallel modes in combination with specific model parameter configurations."

msgid "From the Attention computation latency perspective, Qwen3-235B-A22B uses 64-head GQA, while DeepSeek-V3 uses 128-head MLA, with computation latency being approximately 50% of the latter. Considering the impact of memory access latency, actual latency will be slightly higher."

msgid "In summary, in large-scale cluster deployment, comprehensively evaluating from the two dimensions of KV Cache capacity limitations and MoE computational efficiency, Qwen3-235B-A22B can adopt similar deployment modes. Compared to DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-235B-A22B can support longer sequence lengths with better performance in terms of latency and throughput. For compute-constrained cards like H20, EP can be reduced and TP introduced to reduce network latency while achieving good computational utilization."
