msgid "In this chapter, I will present the performance testing tools developed in RTP-LLM, including standalone measurement of model prefill and decode performance under various batch sizes with single-node and multi-node parallelism, timeline recording, and their usage methods."

msgid "Design Principle"
msgstr ""

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:4
msgid "RTP-LLM employs a special batch scheduler that accumulates requests until the specified batch size is reached, then all requests enter the engine simultaneously. The scheduler supports both prefill and decode modes; in decode mode, requests are only allocated KV cache without prefill, enabling accurate and efficient measurement of engine performance. In detail, the batch-scheduler profiler is executed three times for a single input:"

msgid "Warm-up run, to account for one-time setup such as JIT compilation."

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:8
msgid "Profiling run, to capture a timeline for subsequent analysis; this step may degrade end-to-end performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:10
msgid "For every run we use min_new_tokens and max_new_tokens to ensure that all requests perform the same number of decode steps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:12
msgid "Since in decode mode, we not prefill the KVCache, so hidden_states after every forward step is not real. So we also hack moe gate select for moe model and speculative accept func for mtp. In that way, we get stable result for analyse result."

msgid "specially `batch_size` states for the batch in single DP node, when `DP_SIZE` param is setted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:29
msgid "also we support test prefill or decode only when prefill and decode not share the same config(such as prefill use deepep normal, and decode use deepep masked), in that case user should also set `--partial={0:all(default), 1:decode, 2:prefill}`, below is an example of testing decode only:"

msgid "Multi Node Benchmark"
msgstr ""

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:34
msgid "We also provide a Python script to enable multi-node benchmark, but since it requires setting up the environment and starting the script on multiple machines, it still involves more steps than single-node testing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../benchmark/benchmark.md:36
msgid "For each machine to be tested, you need to create an environment in which RTP-LLM can run and support passwordless SSH access from the current machine’s port."

For example, in below config, script will start three server with `TP=1 DP=32`, `TP=2 DP=16`, `TP=4 DP=8` and benchmark"
