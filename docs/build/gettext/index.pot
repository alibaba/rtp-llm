#: ../../index.rst:8
msgid "**Fast Backend Runtime**: Provides efficient serving with RadixAttention for prefix caching, zero-overhead CPU scheduler, prefill-decode disaggregation, speculative decoding, continuous batching, paged attention, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, expert parallelism, structured outputs, chunked prefill, quantization (FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ), and multi-lora batching."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:9
msgid "**Flexible Frontend Language**: Offers an intuitive interface for programming LLM applications, including chained generation calls, advanced prompting, control flow, multi-modal inputs, parallelism, and external interactions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:10
msgid "**Extensive Model Support**: Supports a wide range of generative models (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLaVA, etc.), embedding models (e5-mistral, gte, mcdse), with easy extensibility for integrating new models."
