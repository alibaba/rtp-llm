msgid "Supports structured pruning [LLM-Pruner: On the Structural Pruning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11627). Specifically, for the Attention Layer, the head_num varies layer by layer (where head num can be reduced to 0); for the FFN Layer, the inter_size varies layer by layer. Applied to [Large Language Model based Long-tail Query Rewriting in Taobao Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03758)."
