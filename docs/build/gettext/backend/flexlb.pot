msgstr ""

#: ../../backend/flexlb.md:5
msgid "FlexLB (Flexible Load Balancer) is the Master role in RTP-LLM's distributed inference framework. It implements a multi-dimensional Quality of Service (QoS) Load Balance strategy for large model inference, coordinating between inference workers, cache servers, and other components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../backend/flexlb.md:7
msgid "The Master role was designed to address the limitations of random load balancing that caused uneven load distribution across machines, improving resource utilization for inference worker clusters scaled between 100-1000 nodes."
