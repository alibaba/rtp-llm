msgid "Boost Efficiency: Prefill precomputes attention keys/values (KV caching) for the input sequence, enabling fast autoregressive decoding by reusing cached data—reducing compute from O(n²) to O(n) per token. Optimize Memory: Caching KV matrices during Prefill avoids redundant recomputation, slashing memory overhead during long-sequence generation. Leverage Hardware: Prefill exploits parallel processing for known inputs (full-sequence batched compute), while Decode optimizes latency-critical step-by-step generation. Scale Applications: Separation allows dynamic resource allocation (e.g., high-throughput Prefill for prompts + low-latency Decode for streaming outputs), vital for real-time use cases like chatbots."
