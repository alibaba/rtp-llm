"It is recommended to use a combination of PD (Prefill-Decode) separation "
"and DP (Data Parallelism) for optimal performance. PD separation is "
"employed because of the MHA (Multi-Head Attention) structure, which "
"results in substantial GPU memory consumption from KV cache. Without PD "
"separation, the system would face KV cache insufficiency when handling "
"large max sequence lengths. DP is implemented for similar reasons, aiming"
" to reduce the GPU memory footprint of model weights on each GPU card."
