"Supports structured pruning [LLM-Pruner: On the Structural Pruning of "
"Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11627). Specifically, "
"for the Attention Layer, the head_num varies layer by layer (where head "
"num can be reduced to 0); for the FFN Layer, the inter_size varies layer "
"by layer. Applied to [Large Language Model based Long-tail Query "
"Rewriting in Taobao Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03758)."

"Add two lists in the model's config.json to specify the head_num and "
"inter_size for each layer, and the number of elements in the list needs "
"to be consistent with layer_num. The config needs to be consistent with "
"the trained ckpt. For example:"
