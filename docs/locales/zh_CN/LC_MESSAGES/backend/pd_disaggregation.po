"Boost Efficiency: Prefill precomputes attention keys/values (KV caching) "
"for the input sequence, enabling fast autoregressive decoding by reusing "
"cached data—reducing compute from O(n²) to O(n) per token. Optimize "
"Memory: Caching KV matrices during Prefill avoids redundant "
"recomputation, slashing memory overhead during long-sequence generation. "
"Leverage Hardware: Prefill exploits parallel processing for known inputs "
"(full-sequence batched compute), while Decode optimizes latency-critical "
"step-by-step generation. Scale Applications: Separation allows dynamic "
"resource allocation (e.g., high-throughput Prefill for prompts + low-"
"latency Decode for streaming outputs), vital for real-time use cases like"
" chatbots."
